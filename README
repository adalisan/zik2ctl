To configure device, just run program with the desired --set-xxxx options,
for instance to enable the noise control, type:
$ zik2ctl --set-noise-control=on

If you have multiple Zik2 paired, you can list them using:

$ zik2ctl -l

and select which one you want to connect with the '--device' option
which takes the address of the device.

To get full help, type:

$ zik2ctl --help

Runtime requirements
--------------------
Communication with Zik2 is done using bluetooth connection.
Hence you need at least version 5 of Bluez installed and the bluetooth daemon
should be running.

Building from source
--------------------

For now, Zik2Ctl only require at least version 2.44 of the GLib library.
You will also need a set of tools including:
- autoconf
- automake

Then in the zik2ctl directory, run:
$ autoreconf -fi
to generate build system files, then the usual:
$ ./configure
$ make

Zik2ctl binary will be in the 'src' directory. You can them use it directly
or install it using
$ make install

Known issue
-----------

Bluez may currently need to be patched as current released version (5.36) did
not worked correctly for me. I have to compile the current master to make it
working. The required patch, from what I think, is:
