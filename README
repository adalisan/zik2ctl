Zik2ctl
=======

Zik2ctl is a command line tools to display and configure Parrot Zik2 Headphones
for GNU/Linux environment. It is currently released under the term of the
LGPLv3, see COPYING and COPYING.LESSER for more informations.

Usage
-----
Running zik2ctl without arguments show a list of Zik2 currently paired with
host.

To show current Zik2 state, just type:
$ zik2ctl --device "01:23:45:67:89:AB"
where 01:23:45:67:89:AB is the address of the device shown when running without
arguments.

To configure Zik2, just run with desired --set-xxxx options, for instance to
enable the noise control, type:
$ zik2ctl --device "01:23:45:67:89:AB" --set-noise-control=on

You can get all options with --help.


Runtime requirements
--------------------
Communication with Zik2 is done using bluetooth connection.
Hence you need at least version 5 of Bluez installed and the bluetooth daemon
should be running.

Building from source
--------------------

For now, Zik2Ctl only require at least version 2.44 of the GLib library.
You will also need a set of tools including:
- autoconf
- automake

Then in the zik2ctl directory, run:
$ autoreconf -fi
to generate build system files, then the usual:
$ ./configure
$ make

Zik2ctl binary will be in the 'src' directory. You can them use it directly
or install it using
$ make install

Known issue
-----------

Bluez may currently need to be patched as current released version (5.36) did
not worked correctly for me. I have to compile the current master to make it
working. The required patch, from what I think, is:
